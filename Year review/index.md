# Year Review
## 1. What did you like most about this subject?
I liked that we talked about things related to our field of work. and that we had the opportunity to have this subject with a native speaker.

## 2. What did you like least about this subject?
I liked the content of the homeworks but I did not enjoy the fact that we have to do them on github.

## 3. What were the top 3 things you learned this year?
That I still need to practice more my speaking.
That I should not be lazy to do my case studies properly (but I still will be)
That I should persuade my clients to pay for taking care of the work I do for them after it is finished so they do not butcher it.

## 4. What was the most memorable activity/assignment from this year?
Probably Experience and Storytelling where I could look back on all the work I have done in the short amount of time I do graphic design.

## 5. What is something you accomplished this year that you are proud of?
Everything. There is so much that happened this year again. My work was at the NFT exhibition at NFT Gallery on Staromětské náměstí and at concerts at Kasarny Karlin. With help of people from our school, we made a collection to help Ukraine. I finished my bachelor thesis and so on... I always try to do work I am and will be proud of. 

## 6. What is one thing you learned about yourself this year?
I do not think I have learned anything about myself. I just try to get and be better at everything I do and am.

## 7. What is one thing you would add or change about this class?
As I said, I am not a fan of doing our homework on Github. But I would try to force students to talk more and conversate. Talking and understanding are key in English and I would appreciate having more conversations.

## 8. What is one thing you could have done better this year?
Maybe be less lazy. People think I work too much but I do not think I work enough. 

## 9. What is one thing I could have done better as a teacher this year?
conversate, conversate, conversate, having a native speaker is a great opportunity for students to get better at English.

## 10. What advice would you give to students going into this subject next year?
Be open, talk about anything you have on your mind. You are an awesome person and really easy to talk to. They need to use this opportunity to get better at English and to get to know you better.
