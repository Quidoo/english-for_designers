Making the brand more attractive includes a change of name. That helps extend the focus of the brand. Then create a new visual identity that communicates better with the target group. Tattoo artists express their opinion about these changes through a questionnaire. For them, the brand should be a place to present themselves and their work. Lastly, there is a change of business model too because of economical reasons. The new business model with the use of new media should lower the costs of running the brand and make it more sustainable.

The old name was too specific, unoriginal, and it restricted future growth. The new name Dirty Soul goes better with the tonality of the brand and it is more abstract.
