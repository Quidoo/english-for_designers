# Rebranding of a fashion brand

## Abstract
This work deal with a rebranding of a fashion brand that cooperates with tattoo artists. The aim of this work is to make the brand more attractive to a target group, give tattoo artists space for self-presentation and make the brand more cost-efficient and environmentally friendly. Making the brand more attractive includes a change of name. That helps extend the focus of the brand. Then create a new visual identity that communicates better with the target group. Tattoo artists express their opinion about these changes through a questionnaire. For them, the brand should be a place to present themselves and their work. Lastly, there is a change of business model too because of economical reasons. The new business model with the use of new media should lower the costs of running the brand and make it more sustainable.

## Presentation
#### Old name and visual identity

The old name was too specific, unoriginal, and it restricted future growth. The new name Dirty Soul goes better with the tonality of the brand and it is more abstract.

#### Moodboard

We needed to create a space that communicates with the target audience

When we knew what kind of environment we are working with, we set a direction of a visual identity
