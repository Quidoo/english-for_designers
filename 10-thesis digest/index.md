# Digest: Rabranding of a fashion brand
## Abstract
This bachelor thesis deal with a rebranding of a fashion brand that cooperates with tattoo artists. The aim of this work is to make the brand more attractive to a target group, give tattoo artists space for self-presentation and make the brand more cost-efficient and environmentally friendly. Making the brand more attractive includes a change of name. That helps extend the focus of the brand. Then create a new visual identity that communicates better with the target group. Tattoo artists express their opinion about these changes through a questionnaire. For them, the brand should be a place to present themselves and their work. Lastly, there is a change of business model too because of economical reasons. The new business model with the use of new media should lower the costs of running the brand and make it more sustainable.

## Main Text
Originally I wanted to use this bachelor thesis as an opportunity to create my own fashion brand. I would have creative freedom thanks to that and I would find out what needs to be done to create a fashion brand. I would use this gained knowledge in the future while working with clients to help them understand, what they need to do to start their own brand. Unfortunately, I got stuck at the very start. Other fashion brands did not respond to my massages and I was not able to do my research.

Thankfully I was contacted by a fashion brand called Tattoos on clothes.  It was established during the pandemic to help struggling artists. In their case, they chose to help tattoo artists. These artists create designs for clothes and people can buy them and support them. But they had problems with visual communication. It did not communicate with the target audience. Then there was a need for a change of their name. It was too specific which restrict them from future growth.

I liked the thought behind the brand so I wanted to use a rebrand of Tattoos on Clothes as a topic of my bachelor thesis. Everything went smoothly. Owners were young people open to new ideas. We changed the name of the brand and made a new logo. But after a few weeks, I was told that they do not have money to run the brand and they canceled it. I decided to continue with the rebrand on my own. I wanted to create into brand and community that tattoo artists want to work with. I did not want to only sell t-shirts but I wanted to create a space of exposure for the artists. Because of financial problems, I changed the business model of the brand too. I wanted the brand to be cheap to run and sustainable.
