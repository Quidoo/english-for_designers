## Thrown into a technical world
This little boy was always creative and wanted to create something. He wanted to be an architect when other kids were aspired to be policemen or astronauts. This little boy is of course me and I was pursuing this career until the last possible moment. I was Going to drawing classes, admiring buildings, and reading magazines about architecture. I actually did not know anything about architecture and styles but that did not stop me. What actually stopped me was choosing distance and laziness. When I was choosing a high school, I was so sure that I would go to a civil engineering school. Instead, I ended up at mechanical engineering school. I was not confused by the names. The other one was closer. One could say that at this point my creativity was destroyed.   into this technical world full of norms and there was no coming back.

## Digital drawing? Not for me.
I hope that you will be happy to hear that my urge to create did not die. I wanted to get back into drawing. I was used to pen and paper but there was this exciting digital world. I wanted to get into that. So, I bought a Wacom tablet and started drawing. Some things were good, most were terrible. I was trying different styles and different programs but I felt that this is not the right thing for me. I even tried to start a career as a youtuber. Creating and cutting videos is creative too. But that was a miss too.

## Band needs a logo
Well, forgot to mention. There was another creative thing in my life. I always loved music and I played drums since I was twelve. Why I did not strive to be a musician? Even though I loved it, I have never seen it as something I would want to do for a living. And I can't read notes for sh.t. But I have played in many different bands throughout the years. They all felt apart but one seemed to stick. We were called Exclusive. But we have never played anywhere so we were more Inclusive. We recorded some of our own songs and I wanted a logo for our band. I had no idea what I was doing. I drew something on my Wacom tablet and knew that logo should be a vector. So, I downloaded this abomination called Gimp and I made it somehow. My first logo.

## I guess this could be it
I liked that. It was creative yet technical. I wanted to do more of those. I downloaded Illustrator and I started to learn. Yes, I pirated it, please don't tell Adobe. But I was immediately discouraged. "That does not look or work at all like the other drawing program? I don't get it? What the hell am I supposed to do here?!" When I cooled down I opened some tutorials and started to learn the very basics. "I have a Pc and Illustrator. That means I am a graphic designer, right?" So I did my first commission work. Which I did not get paid for because they decided they don't want it. But here it is! My first logo for a real client. Specifically for a Czech Beatbox community. I still have no idea, if that is a real thing.

## Starting… slowly.
But I wanted to learn more about the program. I still had no clue what I can do with it and how to properly use it. And the best way to do learn is to do the most advanced thing I can think of, of course. I found a tutorial on Skillshare by a talented artist Jonathan Ball. Even tho the tutorial was for a different program, I started to do Illustrations in Illustrator and took a deep dive into all the features. Because starting slowly is for suckers, I started creating a massive artwork that took me a month to do. I even used Inventor for the buildings, which is 3D engineering software we used at school.

## Show them what I got
Now, when I can use the program like a pro, I should start to create some logos. I was binge-watching logo design tutorials by William Peterson on YouTube. I have learned what else goes into creating a quality logo. I have the skills, I have the knowledge, the only thing I need is my own agency and website. So, I made an insanely bad website. Called my agency BAD, short for Best Affordable Design, haha, funny Jorje, and put my stuff on Instagram. Now it all seems stupid. But it actually gave me some clients through friends and I was able to gain some experience. I was getting better at logo design and learned that I have no idea what I am doing.

## I need to learn more
Yes, I did not know how to work with clients, how to price my work, nothing. So, I found a YouTube channel called The Futur. This guy Chris Do, and his employees and his clients showed me that there is so much I don't know. It wasn't even funny. So I started to learn and found out, that there is much more to a design and brand than just a logo. I needed to know everything! I started to learn about visual identity, brand identity, layouts, grids, fonts... I was consuming all that content like a hungry American kid in McDonald's. I have found a whole new world and I loved it.

## Let's finish this school
The end of high school has come. I have finished my design of a transmission, almost aced graduation exams. Now it's time to leave school with my newly found passion. So, what would be the best school for me to study? Engineering of course!... wait that does not seem right. But it was. The only thing I needed to get into Czech technical university was to graduate in math. And I wasn't definitely skilled enough to do graphic design full-time. I was fully aware of that.

## First client
The word got around and I have found myself first and long-term client. I could write a book about this guy. Let's just say I have learned some new stuff by working for him and earned some money while studying. I have designed my first brand from scratch and created some other cool things. But after almost 3 years I realized what a horrible client and person he is. This guy is a big chapter in my graphic design journey. But there is nothing more you need to know about it for now.

## Mum, pick me up, I am scared
So yeah, about the school, I didn't like it. It was god damn hard, I did not have fun at all, and there was too much homework. In my free time, which I did not have much, I was learning and creating. I was hearing from left and right "Why are you here?", "You should study graphic design.", "It doesn't make sense for you to study here.". Yes, they were right, why am I still here? I was able to finish the school, I had all finals, but I just did not want to be there. So I send an application to art school called UMPRUM. I didn't sleep at all during the upcoming half a year. I was creating a portfolio for the entry exams, dusting my drawing skills, and learning the history of art, which I didn't have during high school. While creating the portfolio I have extended my graphic design passion and started to create art posters. But about that later. I didn't want to burn my bridges tho and I was still doing everything to school. I have finished my portfolio for which I have created 30 logos, 6 visual identities (some for real clients), 10 art posters, and 1 illustration. My finals started.

## So much energy wasted… or not?
Yep, my finals were at the same time as my entrance exams. I was drained like a rolled-up toothpaste but I was ready for everything. Or maybe not for everything. I didn't get into UMPRUM. Only ten people went to the second round. I was told that I was right below the line and I should come next year. I can’t, already wasted two years but I have successfully finished my finals and I could continue to study. That sounds, like it's over, right? Maybe not. My friend told me about this private school. But I didn't know if I want to go to a private school but I want to check it anyway.

## Let me in!
No need to stretch it even more. I loved it, I wanted in, I got in, I said screw you Engineering school and now I am here! Here I can finally fully pursue my passion and grow as a person and as a graphic designer.

## My work, my life
As you could see in my old portfolio there are two sides to my graphic design personality. The work one which specializes in visual identities and branding and artistic one. The work one is creative but still takes a very technical approach. The work has to look good but most importantly it has to work. It has to communicate correctly the brand to the end customer. The creative one tries to experiment, think out of the box, learn new media, be different. Both are important and fulfilling to me. Both grew very much since I started here thanks to the space and time, I had to devote to it. And I would not have that time if I had not taken the risk of leaving the school and career path, I was in.

But don't take my word for it. See the progress I made for yourself.
