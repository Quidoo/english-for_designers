## Key Points

<!-- Key points; aim for **30–60 words** each. -->

1. Background/importance of topic: Complete rebrand of a fashion brand.
2. Purpose/hypothesis (thesis or statement of problem): Renaming too descriptive name of the brand. Rebranding visual identity the target audience can not connect with. Strengthening communication on social media. Unite community of tattoo artists and lovers of tattoos.
3. Research — design/methodology/approach including procedures/data/observations: I have researched competition in the field. Communicated with tattoo artists, what they like, what to do with the brand so they feel connected to it. I determined visual style and accordingly designed the brand.
4. Findings (highlight outcome of research): I have taken over the brand and set a new business model. That is justified financially and it goes hand to hand with using new media and presenting the clothes and motives in virtual space (3D).
5. Conclusions (significance/success of study to theory/practical/society): Success would be creating a passionate community. A community that talks about tattoos, introducing known and less known tattoo artists, giving them a chance to show their work to more people. That buys motives from these tattoo artists on clothes. Artists have a way to see their motives not only on clothes and the community can support them in another way than getting a tattoo.
